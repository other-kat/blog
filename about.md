hi! I'm [kat][kat-website], i make sound, performance and visual art in london (and further afield). i run the [london community laptop orchestra][lclo-link] and generally make art focused on how, as artists, we both heal and hurt ourselves, with a particular focus on the ways in which we can create engaging and raw work while holding ourselves accountable for the perpetuation of self-damaging behaviours through our art. 

i also write! normally about gender, identity, art, travel and life.
