<p>hi! Iâ€™m <a href="https://otherkat.com">kat</a>, i make sound, performance and visual art in london (and further afield). i run the <a href="https://lclo.otherkat.com">london community laptop orchestra</a> and generally make art focused on how, as artists, we both heal and hurt ourselves, with a particular focus on the ways in which we can create engaging and raw work while holding ourselves accountable for the perpetuation of self-damaging behaviours through our art.</p>

<p>i also write! normally about gender, identity, art, travel and life.</p>
