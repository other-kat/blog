my dad told me he was dying. not in any way thats urgent. 
more a life expectancy thats short. 
i've been feeling numb since. flew to shanghai and still seem to feel numb. i write this while i'm eating noodles, so my metaphors are food based and the feeling looks like the broth
slight colour but mostly transparent. the occasional thought of "my father will die soon", followed by nothing. no emotional resonance or big moment of feeling. just numb

my instagram keeps recommending me this video of jake gyllenhaal. he's talking about how he doesn't love his wife even though she's dead. it then cuts to him demolishing a kitchen. i haven't really understood it the first few times its played but now i understand it. it's about the broth.

a few days ago at a family mart, the clerk stopped me before i left. id' come in for moisturiser and some blister plasters. she ran to the ail and grabbed a pack of plasters and took my hand. applying it to my cracked knuckles she gives me a little smile and says "better"

i keep thinking about this moment and it feels like the most emotionally resonant moment of my week.

when i came back a few days later (for a pocari sweat this time), so called me something affectionate but infantilising and took my hand again to check on it. she beamed back at me "better".

the interaction has made me afraid to go near the shop again. it feels too vulnerable now like in some way she cares too much and its a pressure on me. i worry i'll cry if i see her and not know why.
