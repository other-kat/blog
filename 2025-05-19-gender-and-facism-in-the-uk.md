**gender and facism in the UK - 19.05.2025**

in the last few years we've directly seen the results of decades of slow but persistant facism, taking hold in the UK. it feels sudden. like all of this was gently distant only a couple of decades ago. like its somehow grown so much in the past few years, but this was never the case. it was there. its always been there and now, due to our own complacency, our willingness to let it fester, to be passive, it has begun to bear fruit. 

the recent supreme court ruling, the ehrc guideance and the various attempts to amend the data bills are not even the start, they are a continuation of a virus that has been working far longer than any of us have been alive.

*i've never really held a proper understanding of what it means to be part of a community. spending my childhood moving from place to place every 2 years, i never understood what it was to be known within any form of collective body. this upbringing has left me somewhat isolated, in a ways that i've spent the last few years trying to rectify.*

upon seeing the barrage of new regulations, guidance and legislative attacks my first instinct was to run. initially from my gender, back into the closet again. then to flee the country, find somewhere far away from this, an imagined place where i'd be safe and at peace. that place doesn't exist. facism always finds a way. and i'm done running.

i know a lot of people in my community are scared. i know lots of people who are feeling the same thing. locked in the same flight response that is triggered when we feel the untenable pressure of a system that hates us and wants to eradicate us. because make no mistake, thats what they want. they don't want us out of 'gendered spaces'. they want us out of **public space**. and they have been building the tools to remove us. 

the meta text of the recent announment is clear "the nail that sticks out, gets hammered down". get in line or fear public exclusion. well no more. for decades we've begged and pleaded for an understanding and acknowledgement that will never come, from a system that does not care.

transness exists in motion, a state in perpetual flux. we must all exist in a fluid embrace of genderlessness. our movement (and at this point more than ever, we **must** embody a movement) should encourage all to join in this. it's now become critical that the removal of gender is a political position, one which anyone can and must join. we must believe this is possible. we must believe we can win.

womens spaces are **our** spaces. they talk about safety. they talk about fear. **good**. they are right to fear us. for if oppression comes from fear, and our freedom is a threat, then we have something real. we have something that, at its core, is so powerful that it has governments quaking. we represent something so threatening we could change the world.

*i often struggle to place myself in a future where i'm free. but now more than ever, its important that i do. important that we all do.*

*when i'm old i wish to live by the sea. i want to wake up and take a walk to the beach. sit by the shore and feel at peace. feel free of constant and ever present press of oppression. to know that things will be different moving forward. know that i helped. know that i'm safe.*

we need to be in the streets. we need to be organising. we need to be mobilising. we need to fighting. and if we are tired, we need to be reinforcing our communities so we can keep fighting. we must keep fighting and to do that, we must know that we can win.

*i never understood community. it made me feel terrified. the idea of being known. the responsibility of social relationships. but i, more than ever, need it. we all do.*

-----

<br>
our social connections make us. our community must grow. it must flourish in solidarity with all others existing under oppression. to quote a popular chant from the Palestinian solidarity movement: "We are All Palestinians", we must all also "all be trans". we must understand that all opression is connected and for any of us to be free, we must all be free.

*i'm angry. i'm filled with rage. i've watch this government carry out a genocide. i've watched it deport thousands upon thousands of people. i've watched it murder its own citizens without reprocussion. i've watched it drive people to suicide. i've watched it limit my rights. i've watched it destroy communities. i've watched it starve its citizens. i've watched it choose to sacrifice those most vulnerable for profit. and i am done with just watching.*

insitutions have failed us. the state has failed us. the system has failed us. no longer can we believe in change happening under the current structures of power. we must reject them.

we have marched. we have signed petitions. we have advocated. we have read. we have wrote. we have pleaded. 

if you are not already. join the following organisations. get involved. learn how you can help. learn how we can be a movement that is pro-active rather than re-active. no longer can we ask nicely.
